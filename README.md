Perfetto, preparerò un README per la tua repository "JakeKing0001/board-verse-new" che includa un grafo interattivo generato con gitdiagram. Mi occuperò di identificare i componenti principali del progetto, descriverne le funzionalità e strutturarlo per facilitare la comprensione dell'architettura.

Ti aggiornerò a breve con la bozza del README.


# Boardverse

Boardverse is a web platform dedicated to board games (initially focusing on **chess**), designed to connect players of all skill levels in a unified digital space.  It lets users play chess online, solve puzzles, and interact with friends or other enthusiasts worldwide.  Future expansions are planned (e.g. adding games like Checkers).

## Key Features

* **Multiple gameplay modes:** Player vs. AI (using the Stockfish chess engine), local multiplayer on one device, online PvP matches (private or public lobbies), and chess puzzles.
* **User profiles & stats:** Each player has a profile tracking games played, wins, and other performance metrics.
* **Authentication & security:** Secure user registration and login, with password hashing via bcryptjs.
* **Social interaction:** Friend system and real-time chat; players can invite friends directly into private matches.
* **Real-time updates:** Game moves, chat messages, and notifications are synchronized in real time via Supabase.
* **Modern, accessible UI:** Responsive design, multi-language support (English, Italian, Spanish, French, German), dark/light themes, and integrated 3D animations using Three.js.
* **Technologies:** Frontend built with **Next.js** (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Three.js); backend/database via **Supabase** (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Realtime); AI integration using the Stockfish Chess Engine API; UI components from Headless UI and icon libraries.

## Architecture

The repository follows a standard Next.js structure. The `src/` directory contains most of the application code:

* `src/app/` – Next.js pages and API route handlers.
* `src/components/` – Reusable React UI components.
* `src/lib/` – Supabase client setup and utilities.
* `src/services/` – Client-side service functions (e.g. API calls).
* `src/public/` – Static assets (images, 3D models, etc.).

At the project root, configuration files and manifest are included (e.g. `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`).

Below is a high-level architecture diagram of Boardverse. It shows the main components (nodes) and data flows between them, using **GitDiagram** syntax:

```gitdiagram
# Nodes
Client:User's Browser
NextApp:Boardverse Frontend (Next.js + React)
Supabase:Supabase (Auth, Realtime)
Database:PostgreSQL (Supabase DB)
Stockfish:Stockfish Chess AI
# Flows
Client --> NextApp
NextApp --> Supabase
NextApp --> Stockfish
Supabase --> Database
```

In this diagram, the **Client** (user’s browser) communicates with the Next.js-based frontend. The frontend interacts with **Supabase** services for authentication, database storage, and real-time updates, and it also queries the **Stockfish** chess engine for AI moves. Supabase manages the PostgreSQL database (via the **Database** node), storing game state, user data, chat messages, etc. Real-time game state and chat synchronization are handled by Supabase’s realtime features.

## Installation

To run Boardverse locally, first ensure you have Node.js v18+ and a package manager (npm, Yarn, or pnpm) installed. Then execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakeKing0001/board-verse-new.git
cd board-verse-new
npm install
```

Optionally, create a `.env.local` file in the project root to configure a custom Supabase backend. For example:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anonymous-key
```

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
